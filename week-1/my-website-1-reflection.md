# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

From the GitHub website, select the + icon at the top right hand side of the screen and click on "new repository" from the drop-down menu. This will take you to a screen where you can edit certain aspects of the repository. You can alter the title of your repo and also select the privacy settings and license features of your repo. Next, click "create repository" to be taken to the landing page of your repo. You will then see a link on the right side of the page to clone this repo. You can copy and paste this URL into your terminal in order to finish cloning the repo into your local computer. Simply type "git clone URL" into the terminal, with URL representing the link you copied from the GitHub site.

# Describe what open source means.

Open source is the sharing of software code for the general public. Many companies keep their code secret in order to protect the commercial value of their product (Adobe, many games, operating systems). However, open source software shares code in order to have a community of coders who may be able to make some improvements or contributions to software. GitHub is an example of a network of open source software that users can browse, push to their local computers and make changes to.

# What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open Source seems like a great idea to me. If somebody knowingly creates software that is open source, then they are working on a project with the understanding that it may be shared with others at the expense of commercial profit. Open Source is a great way for users to communicate with one another in order to learn through coding and work through creative challenges. I am not at all nervous about the implications of Open Source, but perhaps this feeling will develop the more I use git and Open Source programming.

# Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses are important because they have the potential to protect the author of the original software while also clarifying to others how they can legally access and distribute the code. Many of these licenses range from being somewhat restrictive to being completely open. Although some of the licenses allow free distribution and modification of software, these licenses should be put in place. For example, although a GNU license allows a user to charge for distributing software, the distributor must also inform the customer that the Open Source software is also available free of charge.

# What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

This challenge was relatively straightforward. I struggled with some snags in git with the previous challenge, but not I feel like I have a good grasp of pushing and pulling information to and from GitHub. I still have to look up some of the commands when I am working in the terminal, but I'm hoping these commands will be committed to memory soon. I can say that I have a better understanding of how GitHub works and why it is a beneficial tool. 

# Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

I did a bit of research to understand the purpose of staging in git. I found an explanation on Stack Overflow to describe staging. I undestand how to do staging, but I'm still a bit unclear as to why we even stage. If you immediately commit right after staging, can't you just skip the staging part altogether? Perhaps I'm a bit unsure because I am still new to git.
