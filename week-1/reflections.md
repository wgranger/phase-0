# 1.1 Think About Time

There were several time management techniques that seemed interesting to me such as the growth mindset and creating habits. However, I was most drawn to using meditation no only to improve concentration but to improve memory and creativity. In the past I have made some passing attempts at meditation, but I would really like to strengthen that concentration muscle in order to block out distractions. 

I currently use a sort of Pomodoro technique to manage my time. I will often take breaks in the middle of my task to keep myself from getting too bogged down in work. Unfortunately, these breaks often take too long and I become distracted with something random. Because of this, I don't feel like my current strategy works. Although I usually get my work done, it might take two or three times longer to complete a task. I would like to work on meditation so I can begin to tune out distractions and keep focused on the task at hand.

Time boxing seems like a form of the Pomodoro technique. Instead of giving a short period of time to work on a task, you are given a predetermined amount of time to complete a task. I can see this working during phase 0 by setting a sort of weekly schedule where I will put aside some time each day to work on phase 0 tasks. At the end of that time I can take a look back at what was completed. My plan for phase 0 is to make my time spent on Dev Bootcamp tasks more effective. Instead of working on a task for a few minutes and getting up to take a shower, read an article, or surf the web, I'll try to stay focused and maybe use some meditation techniques I learn along the way to make the best of study time.

# 1.2 The Command Line

1. I had to do a bit of research to discern the differences between shell and bash. Shell is basically the way in which a user interacts with whatever operating system she or he is using. The interaction between a user and OS might use a command-line interface or graphical user interface. The "bash" is both a Unix shell and command language. Terminal in OSX uses the bash shell.

 

2. This material started out pretty easy, but there were definitely some moments where I got a bit lost. For example, I was a bit confused with the greater than and less than commands because it seemed like some files were doing a bit of overwriting. I'll probably need to practice using these commands a bit more to get a good grasp of them. I'm also a bit confused why we would use piping when we could write out the commands directly, but I'm sure the piping will make more sense in the future.


3. I was successfully able to use the commands. I eventually felt pretty comfortable navigating through my directories using the command line. Although I wasn't doing too much by going up directories and moving files, it was nice to move through my computer by using the terminal. I have always noticed the terminal sitting in the utilities folder of my Mac. I feel kind of like things have come full circle from being a kid and launching programs using DOS to creating and editing files using the terminal.


4. I feel like the "man" command is a powerful tool to use when I get stuck or want some more explanation of commands. However, I might use the internet for a more straightforward explanation of command line functions. I found myself using the "pwd" and "ls" command quite often just to remind myself of where I was in the directories.


5. pwd - "Print working directory." This command tells the user where he or she is located in the directories.

ls - This command lists all the directories and files that are contained within the working directory the user is currently located.

mv - This command will move a particular file or directory into a specified location.

cd - "Change directory" This command will take the user to a specified directory.

../ - This command will take the user one directory back. For example, when used with "cd ../" the user will move one directory back.

touch - This command creates a blank file. I know this command can create blank .txt files, but I feel like I will be using it much more in the future to create files with other extensions.

mkdir - "Make directory" This command will create another directory/folder in a specified location.

less - This command will display a file directly within the bash. In the instance of a text file, the text will take up the entirety of the screen, allowing the user to page backward or forwards. In order to exit this, the user must press "q."

rmdir - "Remove directory" This will delete a specified folder/directory.

rm - "Remove" this command will delete whatever file it is told to.

help - This command is like a quick guide to the bash. This will display a list of different commands that can be used within the bash. 

# 1.4 Forking and Cloning

In order to create a new repo, a user must click on the drop-down menu from GitHub and select the option to create a new repository. The user can then edit the new repo however he or she wishes. Forking a repo is just as easy, and involves clicking on the fork icon while viewing a particular repo. You can then select to which user you would like to fork the repo. Cloning a repo is a bit more involved, but still rather simple. Simply access the repo you want to clone under GitHub and copy/paste the "clone" link on the right side of the page. Next, open the terminal and navigate to the directory where you would like to place the repo. Enter the comman "git clone <url>" (where URL is the copy/pasted link from GitHub. Running the command should complete the clone. 

Forking a repo is important if a user would like to make changes to or modify a project they are working on. This is important to do when working on a repo that has several different users contributing information.

I didn't have many difficulties working through the git and GitHub activities in this release, but I would like to have some more practice using the Terminal with some git work. I learned that GitHub has all the right tools to make uploading and working on git pretty simple.
