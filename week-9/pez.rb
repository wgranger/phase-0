# PezDispenser Class from User Stories

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# I spent [#] hours on this challenge.


# 1. Review the following user stories:
# - As a Pez user, I'd like to be able to "create" a new Pez dispenser with a group of flavors that
#      represent Pez so it's easy to start with a full Pez dispenser.
# - As a Pez user, I'd like to be able to easily count the number of Pez remaining in a dispenser
#      so I can know how many are left.
# - As a Pez user, I'd like to be able to take a Pez from the dispenser so I can eat it.
# - As a Pez user, I'd like to be able to add a Pez to the dispenser so I can save a flavor for later.
# - As a Pez user, I'd like to be able to see all the flavors inside the dispenser so I know the order
#      of the flavors coming up.


# Pseudocode



# Initial Solution

class PezDispenser
  attr_accessor :number
  attr_accessor :contents
  
  def initialize(flavors)
    array = []
    x = 1
    while x < 13 do
    array << flavors[rand(flavors.length)]
      x+=1
    end
    @contents = array
    @number = @contents.length
  end
  
  def pez_count
    @contents.length
  end
  
  def see_all_pez
    p @contents
  end
  
  def add_pez(taste)
    @contents.push(taste)
    @number +=1
  end
  
  def get_pez
    return @contents.pop
  end
  
end

puts "The pez flavor you got is: #{super_mario.get_pez}"
