# Factorial

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].


# Your Solution Below
def factorial(number)
  result = 1
  i = 0 
  while i < number
  	i = i+1
  	result = result * i
  end
  return result
end


###  Pseudocode  ###

=begin 
define method
	factorial result to one
	counter tracks number of products (set to zero)
	begin while loop
		while counter is less than initial number
			counter increases by one
			factorial = factorial times counter
			loop is repeated until number is reached with counter
		end
		return factorial
