# 0. total Pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!

# Input: An array of numbers
# Output: The sum of the numbers in the array
# Steps to solve the problem.
=begin
define method that takes array as parameter
  default total to zero
  for each item in the array, add it to total
  return total

# 3. total refactored solution

# N/A

# 4. sentence_maker pseudocode
# make sure all pseudocode is commented out!
# Input: array of words
# Output: sentence
# Steps to solve the problem.
=begin
define a method that takes parameter array of strings
  set result to first string capitalized
  iterate over the rest of the strings
  append string to result with space before
