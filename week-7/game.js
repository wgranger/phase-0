 // Design Basic Game Solo Challenge

// This is a solo challenge

// Your mission description: You are stuck in Mobile, AL and need to get
// back to Memphis, TN. Raise money by playing cee-lo, or lose your money
// and stay stuck in Mobile.
// Overall mission: Bet on cee-lo
// Goals: Raise $50 to purchase a bus ticket
// Characters: Player, Opponant
// Objects: Player (money, bet), Opponant
// Functions: Player Roll, Opponant Roll 

// Pseudocode
// Log a description into the console of the game mission
// Declare a player object that has properties of cash as integer and 
//   ticket as boolean
// Write a "bet" function that takes a baseball team as an argument
// 
//
//

// Initial Code
console.log("You are stuck in Mobile, AL with $10 and need $50 to buy a ticket
	back to Memphis. Roll the dice to try to win enough in Cee-Lo to buy a bus ticket!")

var player = {
	cash: 10,
	ticket: false,
}

bet: function(team) {
	if(team === "cardinals"){cardinals}

}
