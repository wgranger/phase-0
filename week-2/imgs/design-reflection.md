# What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The six phases of web design include: 
**Information Gathering** - What do you want your site to accomplish? Decide what the purpose and goals of your site will be.
**Planning** - Use a wireframe to create a sitemap.
**Design** - Decide what the website will look like and create a prototype or spreadsheet of the design.
**Development** - This is the actual building of the website using HTML and CSS code.
**Testing and Delivery** - Cover all the components of the website and insure the site looks good on different devices and browsers.
**Maintenance** - Who will provide updates to the website and how will this be implemented? 
These six phases cover the creation of a website from a concept to the upkeep of the website after the initial launch. 

# What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

The primary goal of my personal website is to attract people to my portfolio and get people to get a good sense of who I am as a person. My website should give others a good impression of myself. As for content, I should have some examples of my work on the page once I create a portfolio, and I should probably have some form of a resume. Overall, I think design is the main thing that will make my site attractive.

# What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

My target audience is interested in seeing how I am different from any other web developer. Aside from content, there should be some element of my site that holds a person's interest. Again, I think the design element (the first impression upon viewing the page) is so important because it gives the audience an example of the work I've created just by looking at the appearance of the site.

# What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

Upon first accessing the website, I want my user to choose what exactly he or she wants to do. I'd rather not have a search bar and instead would like my website to rely on simplicity, giving the user a few clickable options where they can find whatever information they are searching for. 

# What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

I think people should go further than simply creating a prototype of the layout of their website. From viewing several resources about design, your website can convey certain moods given your choice of color and font. It's always important to keep in mind how your website will be seen by visitors to the page. You should not overlook crucial design elements simply to get a website finished and launched. 

# What is user experience and why is it valuable?

User experience determines just how easy it is for a visitor to navigate your website. Was the website logical and beautifully designed, or was it difficult to find information through a barrage of broken links and overlapping images? Users can get distracted and disinterested by a number of different issues, and it is up to the website designer and others to make sure a user's visit to a website is worthwhile and there is a good chance he or she will return to the page again. 

# Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

This challenge wasn't tedious, but there was some technical knowledge I didn't quite understand in some of the external links. It was interesting to read about how different image types effect page load times, but I feel like this was a good bit of information to take in all at once. I'll hopefully grasp the difference between different image types in the future.
