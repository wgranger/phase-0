<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

I felt accomplished. It's nice to be able to create a simple site so quickly. Basic HTML isn't too difficult, but it's rewarding to see results quickly just by opening a file on a browser. I felt much more comfortable cloning a site from scratch because I had to determine which tags to insert into the page rather than regurgitating what Code Academy told me to.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I'm curious how many style guides and cheat sheets have switched over to HTML5. I feel like many of the references I use are written with HTML4 in mind. That said, there are so many resources on the internet for HTML code that I feel like I can always find what I'm looking for when I turn to the internet for help. Most of my issues were solved pretty quickly after clicking on the first result from a search engine.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

We did pretty well, although there were a couple instances when my partner and I considered styling our HTML so that it better matched the site we were cloning. However, the site we were creating was rather simple, and we were able to insert all of the content without needing to style much of the site.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

HTML seems like a wonderful too to insert content into a website. It's straightforward to just type up what you want to display and having it appear on the page. I believe the real challenge with HTML will become apparent when I start inserting different sections (borders, images, buttons, etc.) into a website. The more information I include into a website, the more room for error. Although HTML is rather simple at this point, I think it will be much more difficult to realize more complicated webpages.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Keeping nested items logical and tidy has always led to cleaner and logical code, in my opinion. Although HTML can, at times, look complex on screen, the code is much more simple when broken apart into individual tags and attributes. I think it's also nice to remember that HTML is written pretty straight forward. For example, if you want to change the color of text, you will change just that "color" when typing in your code. Much of the HTML is written exactly as you would image to the point where a person with no HTML experience could deduce what would happen when styling is changed.
