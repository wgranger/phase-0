# What is a wireframe?

A wireframe is a sort of sketch for how you want a website to look. There are many free tools available on the internet that will help you get your thoughts down onto a template, but even a sketch with pencil and paper will count as a wireframe. A wireframe doesn't have to be perfect and contain all of the content exactly as it will appear on the website, but a wireframe should give somebody a good idea of what the website will look like once it is finished.

# What are the benefits of wireframing?

The benefits of wireframing are that you can get a good sense of the visual aspects of a website. It is much easier to get working on a website if you already have an idea of what the site will look like instead of having to create everything as you go. The wireframe will also give a team of developers, and others involved, an agreed upon idea of the website before implementation. It would be a huge waste of time if a website was developed without a consensus and time was wasted because some people decided they didn't like the finished product.

# Did you enjoy wireframing your site?

I enjoyed using the tools given to me (Mockingbird) to create my website. Mockingbird had simple drag and drop tools that made it easy to get a wireframe of my site up and running. Although I know my wireframe should be simple, I was still getting a bit bogged down with wanting to make all of my colors and fonts correct. Mockingbird didn't give me this option, but it's probably for the best so I didn't go down a wireframing rabbit hole.

# Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?

I did revise my wireframe once. I had an idea in my head of what I wanted the site to look like, but after making an initial wireframe I realized it looked pretty boring. I deleted everything and decided to start again. Honestly, the design I came up with takes a bit from an existing site, so I hope I can alter it a bit before I start actually coding the site and publishing it. I really like the design aspect of creating a website. I think even the most boring company or product could be made to look exciting if they have a visually appealing website.

# What questions did you ask during this challenge?  What resources did you find to help you answer them?

I suppose the only questions I asked myself is how can I make a website stand out. Wireframing doesn't seem too technically challenging, so I wasn't browsing the internet for help on any specifics. However, I did search the internet for some design ideas. I think the best resource I had on this aspect was just browsing the web and finding some things that stood out to me.

# Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?

I liked getting my ideas down into a wireframe. Making some drafts and playing around with ideas was the most rewarding, especially because some things I thought were good ideas looked pretty bad once I actually took a look at them. Nothing was too tedious on this challenge. I imagine the tedious step will be realizing the design once I begin some HTML coding.
