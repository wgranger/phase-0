How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The DevTools inspector are like a lab that will let me experiment with different ideas and tags. It's nice that I can use the devtools to see changes that are made realtime. This is especially helpful while fine-tuning positioning aspects, because it is often difficult to get everything just right on the screen. 

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

It's nice that the DOM shows the exact padding, margins, and position of an element laid out like a diagram. It's even better that I can type directly into the diagram to see how sizing will change the shape and position of an element. So, there are really two ways to resize elements using CSS. I can type directly into the diagram that displays, or I can use CSS tags to insert what changes I want made into the styling section. For this activity, we were pretty excited to find out we could adjust the shape of each element just by inserting out dimensions (in em or px).

What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

The way I understand positioning is as follows. Static positioning isn't really any sort of positioning, and the object will appear just as it normally would on a document free from any specs. Relative will initially place an object in the default position, but you are able to change the position by moving the item to the left, right, top or bottom. A fixed item will stay where it is placed on the screen and will retain position as you scroll around the document. This might be good for headers you want to user to see no matter where he is on the page. An absolute position will appear positioned exactly as you tell it to, regardless of other features on the page. Absolute was definitely the best to use in this activity, but I feel that the absolute tag might present some challenges in the future when I am playing with different formats and screen sizes.

What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?

Border is probably the easiest to understand first because we are used to seeing borders in everyday life (as picture frames, fences, photoshop tools, etc.). Simply, borders are the perimenter of an object. Margin and padding can be understood in relation to border. Padding is defined as the space between the content and the border. In turn, margin is the space outside of the border. We can define each of these elements to fine-tune the position and appearance of our object.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)

I enjoyed this challenge because it answered many questions I had about layout. I'm stil a bit curious how some other tags work (inline), but I'll have to do my own research to figure that out. It also seems that absolute, relative, etc. positioning will alter how your object appear inline. I think the Chrome devtools are the best resort when trying to understand how certain elements will affect the webpage.
