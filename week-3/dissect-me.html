      Salutations, dear reader! It is my pleasure and priviledge and responsibility that can't be shirked to tell you of the joys and wonders of Version Control. What is version control, you ask? Well, it's what's going to save your life on multiple occassions. It's basically like a save point in a video game but for your code, with the added exception that you can go back to any save point you want. Allow me to explain:
    </p>
     <p>
       Let's say you're writing a program and you're working on it piece by piece, working on a section here, then a section there. Then you introduce a new bit of code and all of a sudden everything goes to hell. You don't know what's wrong, just that it worked before and it doesn't work now. With version control you can revert back to the previous draft of your work from the save point. Or maybe you deleted some code that you found out later you still needed, or it was written more efficiently before. With version control, it's like hopping in a time machine and bringing up the work from the previous day, or the previous week, or whenever the save point is from. You can even compare your current working version to previous iterations. It's like Marty McFly seeing his younger self in Back to the Future II...Okay, maybe not quite like that, but you can do side by side comparisons to see differences.
      </p>
      <p>
       If you're collaborating with others, it's a great way to track changes. You can create different 'branches' of a project, cloning a file/project from a master copy code so you and your collaborators aren't saving to the same file and writing over each others work. When you're ready, you can merge your sub-branch back to the main-branch.
    </p>
    <p>
       This is where GitHub comes in. Git is a form of version control, but it's stored locally on your computer. GitHub on the other hand is version control, but everything's stored on a server in the cloud. It's like a suped up version of dropbox, all your stuff is on the cloud and you or your collaborators can access, modify, upload whatever you want there. It's a great way to get your work out there, look at what other people are working on, download other people's code, and upload your own. Okay, I said it's like dropbox, but that doesn't quite do it justice. It's also like Behance or Deviant art, it's a place for you to keep your portfolio, to talk and get feedback about code.

      Version control can be used to keep a running tally of all the changes made on files. For example, if I am working on a text file, I can monitor all of the changes made throughout the history of a document and refer back to earlier changes if needed. By making a commit I can take a snapshot of a certain point in a file's history. Each commit is, in a sense, freezing that document in time. 

      Let's say I am writing a story and have made several drafts or commits throughout a month. Perhaps I was on a strange creative kick one day and wrote a bunch of nonsense I though was genius but decided in the future that these changes were unnecessary. Although I might've saved these changes with a commit, I can always undo this save by refering to an earlier commit. Version control allows me to go back in time to an earlier version of this document that I might've liked better.

      Version control gives the user the power to look back at the history of a file's development, and this is an important skill to possess when working on a larger project. Let's say I'm working on a coding file and experimented a little too much and went down a rabbit hole filled with bugs and syntax errors that I just can't shake off. Enter version control! I can just revert back to an earlier, bug-free commit I am sure will work.

        Git can help me keep track of changes through these commits. There's really no end to how many commits can be made, so git can be quite useful in giving me a repository that includes a vast history of all the changes a file has undergone. Each commit has an ID that I can make reference to in the terminal. Although I haven't yet mastered the ability to call upon each particular commit, I'm sure I'll eventually learn how to wield this power in the terminal. However, I've only been working with git for a few days, so there are still many things I've yet to learn.

        GitHub is a powerful tool to use for many of the open source projects I am working on. At this point, I'm working on some more personal, lower-level projects, of which I might be the only author. However, GitHub's benefits really shine when I am working with a team of people. By using my terminal, I can push some working changes made on my computer to a repository stored on GitHub that others can access. 
      
        GitHub can host many types of files that can have public or private access restrictions. Let's say I'm working on a website's code with a team of five people. If I want to edit the banner of the website, I can pull the website code that is hosted on GitHub, make some edits to the code using my local computer, and finally push those changes to GitHub. The pull request will then be viewed on GitHub and, if approved, will be merged with the master code. The beauty of git is that these changes can be made and uploaded without stepping on the toes of a team member who may concurrently be working on a different aspect of the same file.

What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

I'm constantly using the "doctype" tag at the beginning of an HTML document, but I belive it's necessary to use this all the time, so it's good I'm getting into the habit of it. Before phase0 I was unfamiliar with these HTML5 semantic tags, but we seem to be using them with every HTML challenge, so I assume they will be used often once I get out into the coding world after DBC.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

It seems as though the browser displays elements based on their parent-child relationship in the HTML document. This was the main takeaway from this guided pairing session. Before this session, I was a bit unsure how the HTML outline worked and what exactly it meant for one item to have priority over another. 

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

Besies being an application to compose code, I learned that Sublime is the tool of choice because of built-in attributes that make it easy and quick to write. Sublime is pretty smart and often knows what I'm going to do next. I didn't know about the tab auto-complete feature prior to this challenge. That, and the snippets, will probably save me a good bit of time in the future.
